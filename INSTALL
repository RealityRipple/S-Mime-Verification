Installing The S/MIME Verification Plugin
=========================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 0.7 version of the S/MIME
   Verification plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf smime-0.7-1.1.1.tar.gz

2) If you do not need to change the default configuration
   of this plugin, skip to step four.  This may depend on
   whether or not system binaries such as echo and openssl
   are in standard locations.  See the example configuration
   file to confirm.

3) (OPTIONAL) Decide if you want to store the plugin
   configuration file in the plugin directory or in the
   main SquirrelMail config directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the smime directory, copy config_example.php
      to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
      you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd smime
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php
     ----- optional -----

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the smime directory, copy
      config_example.php to ../../config/config_smime.php and
      edit ../../config/config_smime.php, making adjustments
      as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd smime
     $ cp config_example.php ../../config/config_smime.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_smime.php
     ----- optional -----

4) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

5) Also, if not being used with SquirrelMail 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+,
   please verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin
   installed (but not necessarily activated).

6) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

      http://www.squirrelmail.org/download.php



Upgrading S/MIME Verification
=============================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 0.7 version of the S/MIME
   Verification plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf smime-0.7-1.1.1.tar.gz

2) Change into the smime directory and check your
   config.php file against the new version to see if
   there are any new settings that you must add to your
   config.php file.

  $ diff -u config.php config_example.php

   If you store your configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
   config directory, adjust this command as follows:

  $ diff -u ../../config/config_smime.php config_example.php

   Or simply replace your configuration file with the provided
   example and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step three
   under the installation procedure above).
