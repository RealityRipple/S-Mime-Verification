Description
===========

This plugin enables the viewing of S/MIME signed messages (those that
are sent in the "multipart/signed" mime format).  The user is able to
verify the message, the sender's certificate, and can view and download
the certificate.

This plugin requires OpenSSL to be installed, as it does not use the
OpenSSL extensions of PHP (that is a *feature*, since the PHP extensions
have been known to be buggy).

Note that this plugin does NOT *generate* new S/MIME signed emails.

See the file README.vasco for further tips.

License
=======

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public
License (see COPYING for details).



Requirements
============

  * OpenSSL (ALWAYS have the newest version installed!)

  * SquirrelMail version 1.1.1 or above

  * If not using SquirrelMail 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+,
    Compatibility plugin version 2.0.7 or above



Troubleshooting
===============

  * Make sure the plugin is configured correctly by browsing to
    http://your-squirrelmail-location/src/configtest.php

  * If you experience problems related to the programs needed by
    this plugin (echo and openssl), typing "which echo" and
    "which openssl" on a command line can help.  This plugin
    assumes you have these programs installed and available and
    should only be installed once you have those tools.

  * If you are uncertain why a certain signature is not verified
    (when you think it should be), you can execute the verification
    yourself on the command line.  Find the message source file in
    your mail store and use it in the following command:

       cat <message file> | openssl smime -verify -CApath /etc/ssl/certs

    Change the CApath argument as necessary (same as you did in
    the configuration file for this plugin).  You may also save
    the signer's certificate for further inspection:

       cat <message file> | openssl smime -verify -signer <new cert> -CApath /etc/ssl/certs

    Then you can display the signer's certificate details:

       openssl x509 -in <cert file> -text

  * If you make use of the included CA bundle and find that it
    falls out of date, you can always generate a new one yourself.
    A script called "mkcabundle.pl" is included in the data
    directory of this plugin that contains instructions on how to
    do so.  View the contents of that script to learn how to get
    the newest list of root certificates and then how to convert
    them to the correct format.

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be having any
    effect, ensure that you are editing the correct configuration
    file.  If one is located in the main SquirrelMail config directory
    (named "config_smime.php"), it will always be used.  Otherwise,
    "config.php" in the smime plugin directory will be used.



Help Requests
=============

Before looking for help elsewhere, please try to help yourself:

  * Read the Troubleshooting section herein.

  * Make sure the plugin is configured correctly by browsing to
    http://your-squirrelmail-location/src/configtest.php

  * Look to see if others have already asked about the same issue.
    There are tips and links for the best places to do this in
    the SquirrelMail mailing list posting guidelines:
    http://squirrelmail.org/wiki/MailingListPostingGuidelines
    You should also try Google or some other search engine.

  * If you cannot find any information about your issue, please
    first mail your help request to the squirrelmail-plugins
    mailing list.  Information about it can be found here:
    http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/squirrelmail-plugins
    You MUST read the mailing list posting guidelines (see above)
    and include as much information about your issue (and your
    system) as possible.  Including configtest output, any debug
    output, the plugin configuration settings you've made and
    anything else you can think of to make it easier to diagnose
    your problem will get you the most useful responses.  Inquiries
    that do not comply with the posting guidelines are liable to
    be ignored.

  * If you don't get any replies on the mailing list, you are
    welcome to send a help request to the authors' personal
    address(es), but please be patient with the mailing list.
